- Arrays are collections of variables of the same type, and of fixed size, that we access by position
	- Fixed size the operations on elements are highly optimized
	- Dynamic arrays are possible when unsure of size
	- A std::vector might be better in this case
- Setting up arrays
	- type array_name\[dimension]


# Character Array
---
- Character arrays can be init using a string literal, and they end with a null char
```c++
char a1[] = {'C', '+', '+'}
char a3[] = "C++"

```
