- Quite common to have related elements of data, particularly when we are modelling some non-trivial entity
```c++
string name;
float tailLength;
string colouring;
```


# Struct construct
----
- C++ struct is a way to group related data elements
- A struct declaration ends with a semi-colon

```c++
struct Cat
{
	string name;
	float tailLength;
	string colouring;
};
```
