# What is programming
----
- Writing instructions for a computer with the purpose of getting the computer to perform required tasks


# What is C++
----
- One of the world's most popular programming languages
- High-level programming language
- Freedom of control over system resources and memory


# C++ vs Java
----
- Java is object oriented
- C++ can be object oriented too but...
	- Don't have to have classes
	- Can be object based
- Both can be generic

- Platform dependent vs independent
- The JVM is a platform dependent app that runs on OS

- C++ allows more direct control of the hardware resources, including using memory pointers
- C++ is mostly used for desktop applications and system-level programming

```java
public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, world!");
	}
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
