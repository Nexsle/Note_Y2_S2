# Compare Speed
- If we assume that each operation performed takes time, we can conclude that the more operations it performs the longer it takes
- We can use this to give us a means of comparison

# Problem Size
- When we compare algo we are usually interested in how the number of operations performed grows as the problem gets bigger
- We want to know how it grows
- WE refer to the rate of growth in the number of operations performed by an algo as n grows as the complexity of the algo

- We can group algo into complexity classes, algo with approximately the same complexity
