- Basic data structure
	- Array
	- List
	- Stack
	- Queue
	- Record

# Arrays
- An array is a data structure consisting of a fixed number of data items of the same type
- Any array element is directly accessible via an index value
- Arrays can have more than one index
- Initializing an array takes n operations for an array of n elements

# Lists
- A list is a collection of items arranged in some order
- List items are records containing data and a pointer to the next node in the list
- A list may also have a pointer back to the previous node in the list
- Inserting an item onto a list![[Pasted image 20250729160036.png]]
- Insert an item onto a list end![[Pasted image 20250729160100.png]]
- Insert item into a list after a specific node![[Pasted image 20250729160648.png]]


# Stacks
- A stack is a data structure which holds multiple elements of a single type
- elements can be removed from a stack only in the reverse order in which they were inserted
- To put an element on the stack![[Pasted image 20250729161410.png]]
- To remove an element from the stack![[Pasted image 20250729161426.png]]

# Queue
- A queue is a data structure which holds multiple elements of a single type 
- Element can be removed from a queue only in the from in which they were inserted
- To put an element in the queue![[Pasted image 20250729161656.png]]
- To take an element out of the queue![[Pasted image 20250729161723.png]]

# Records (Structures)
- A record is a data structure consisting of a fixed number of items
- Unlike array, the elements in a record may be of differing types and are named
- ![[Pasted image 20250729161829.png]]
- An array may appear as a field in a record
- Records may appear as elements of an array
- Records are typically addressed by a pointer
- Fields of record are accessible via the field name
