Multiplication of four matrices
\<$A_{1},A_{2},A_{3},A_{4}$>
We can define five distinct way to perform the calculation

How we parenthesize a chain of matrices can have dramatic impact on the cost of computing the product

## Step 1: Structure an optimal parenthesization
Lets say an optimal split is between $A_{k}$ and $A_{k+1}$
The problem becomes two sub-problem
