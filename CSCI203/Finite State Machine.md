- Also known as finite-state automation
- FSM Examples
	- Vending machine
	- alarm clock
- A finite state machine M is defined by a five tuple where
	- Q is a finite set of states{q0, q1, q2, ..., qn}
	- F is a subset of final state of Q
	- q0 is a single start state in Q
	- S is an input/output alphabet
	-  : Q x S -> Q maps the current input and current state into the next state
