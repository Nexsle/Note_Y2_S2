Gravity in game always refers to the pull of the earth
Can assume
- m1(of earth) is constant
- r(of earth) and and G are also constant

# Projectile

An object that is placed in motion by a force acting over a very short period

Projectile motion
- Assuming a flat surface
- Trajectory is parabolic

# Friction

Resistance to movement

Static friction: force that prevents obj from moving when it is stationary
Dynamic friction: force act against moving object
Rolling friction
